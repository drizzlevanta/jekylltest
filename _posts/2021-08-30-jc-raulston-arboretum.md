Many exquisite gardens set the stage for displaying new plant introductions at the JC Raulston Arboretum. Many of these areas follow a formal design with a particular theme, while others address contemporary issues or display new techniques in landscape design. Some of the gardens were designed and built primarily by students in landscape horticulture classes. The gardens are maintained by volunteer leaders under the supervision of the JCRA staff. A stroll through the gardens in any season is a rich experience, each one inspiring new ideas that can be directly used in your home gardens and landscapes.

Inherent in the JCRA philosophy is change. When gardens have outlived their potential or become outdated, they are redesigned into new features. This dynamic nature of the gardens ensures opportunities to educate audiences on current trends and techniques in horticulture.
